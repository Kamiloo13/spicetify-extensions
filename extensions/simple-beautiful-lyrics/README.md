### Overview

**Simple Beautiful Lyrics** revamps the Spotify lyrics experience with a focus on simplicity and lightweight. It offers a dynamic background that changes based on the album cover of the current song. The lyrics are displayed in a clean and readable font with an aditional blur effect.

> **This project is a fork of a plugin made by [surfbryce](https://github.com/surfbryce) - [Beautiful Lyrics](https://github.com/surfbryce/beautiful-lyrics)**
> Please check out the original project for even more features. This fork mainly focuses on being lightweight with minimal external packages and APIs.

### Contributing

> The main version of **Beautiful Lyrics** is, in my opinion a bit difficult to contribute, becouse it uses a lot of external APIs and packages. This fork is meant to be simpler.
